# stm32_mmcov4
code for using nucleo-f429zi board with matlab.
will be porting the old code to use the ethernet interface instead of the serial

This version of code was build using STM32CubeIDE release v1.7.

This should compile ok with the 1.9 version too but not migrating the code to the new libraries yet.
